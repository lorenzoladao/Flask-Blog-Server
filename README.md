# Flask Blog Server
## Introduction
A Flask server that runs a Blog website.

## Features
This website currently only has login and signup functionality.

A newly implemented Facial Recognition login is available.

## How to Use
Run the run.py file. You may need to install libraries if necessary.

When registering you MUST add a clear photo of yourself for facial recognition to work

## Improvements
I would like to implement the following features
* Upload Blog functionality
* Delete accounts
* Show camera screen when using facial recognition feature
